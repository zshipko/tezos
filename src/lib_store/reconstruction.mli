(** Storage reconstruction

    The storage reconstruct feature aims to re-compute the contexts
    (ledger state) and the blocks metadata of a full mode storage, and
    thus, migrate a storage from a full history mode to an archive
    one.

    To do so, it is needed to re-play the whole chain, by applying
    (using the standard validation method:
    [Lib_validation.Block_validation.apply]) all the blocks from the
    genesis on empty context. As a storage running a full history mode
    will not store all the ledger state but keeps all the blocks (and
    operations), it is the only mode that can be reconstructed. The
    operation is made of two major steps:
    - Reconstruct the cemented block store: the context of each block
    is restored and, for each cemented cycle, the associated metadatas
    are restored.
    - Reconstruct the floating blocks store: Optional as the floating
    block store may also need to be reconstructed. Indeed, after a
    snapshot import, the floating blocks (before the snapshot's block
    target) are not associated with a stored context and its
    associated metadata.
 *)

(** [reconstruct ?patch_context ~store_dir ~context_dir genesis uau
    uapo] reconstructs the storage located in [store_dir] and
    [context_dir]. The resulting storage will see its history mode
    changed to archive. *)
